# Taxi Data Analysis (Maximizing Revenue for Drivers)

### Project Description:
This project focuses on analyzing taxi fare data to uncover insights that can help drivers maximize their revenue. Using Python, statistical methods, and data visualization, the project explores the impact of different payment methods on fare amounts. By identifying trends in payment modes and evaluating their relationship with fare values, the analysis provides actionable recommendations for taxi drivers and ride-hailing companies. The findings are compiled into a professional presentation to support executive decision-making.

### What problem does it solve?
In the fast-paced taxi booking sector, Making the most of the revenue is essential for long term success and driver happiness. Our goal is to use data-driven insight to maximize revenue streams for taxi drivers in order to meet this need.

Our research aims to determine whether payment methods have an impact on fair pricing by focusing on the relationship between payment type and fare amount.

### Data Description
For this analysis, We utilize the comprehensive dataset of NYC Taxi Trip records, Used data cleaning and feature engineering procedures to concentrate solely on the relevant columns essential for our investigation.<br>

**Relevant columns used for this research:**

Passenger_count(1 to 5) <br>
Payment_type(card or cash) <br>
Fare_amount <br>
Trip_distance(miles) <br>
Duration (minutes) <br>

### Tools & Technologies Used

**Tools:** Jupyter notebook and Power point <br>
**Libraries:** numpy,pandas,seaborn,matplotlib,statsmodels.api,scipy <br>

### Methodology
**Descriptive Analysis:** Performed statistical analysis to summarize key aspects to the data, Focusing on fare amount and payment types <br>

**Hypothesis Testing:** Conducted a T-test to evaluate the relationship between payment type and fare amount, Testing the hypothesis that different payment methods influence fare amounts. 
### Results
With a T-statistic of 165.5 and a P-value of less than 0.05, We reject the null hypothesis, Suggesting that there is indeed a significant difference in average fare between the two payment methods.

### Recommendations
